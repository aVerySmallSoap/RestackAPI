## Purpose of this Project

Restack is a tool that allows developers to discover low-hanging vulnerabilities in their application. Many tools like OWASP's SecureCodeBox allows pentesters to continuously scan for low-hanging fruit issues in the development process. However, it can still be complicated for an average developer to configure these tools.

Restack attempts to alleviate these issues by providing a web application and short guides on how to configure these tools. Furthermore, it tries and creates gui's for tools like Wapiti3.

Restack mainly targets developers who are more comfortable with using tools with graphical interfaces.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As SecureCodeBox states, these tools does **not** attempt to replace penetration testers nor is it a one-button-click solution. Although Restack aims to reduce the need for data interpretation, developers still need to learn how to interpret the data/results to take advantage of these tools. <br/>
>
> Restack is a passion and capstone project! Expect bugs and subpar feature implementation

## Quick Start

## Notes

> [!NOTE]
> 
> This project is heavily inspired by the tools like OWASP's [SecureCodeBox](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox)


This project is aimed to be deployed at ***REDACTED*** as part of a capstone project
